<h2>September</h2>

<h3>September 20, 2021</h3>

<p>It's starting to get cold out there. Fall is in the air and that's what's
  going on.

<h2>August</h2>

<h3>August 18, 2021</h3>

<h2>July</h2>

<p>Whatever you're going through just remember that someone has been down this
  road before. You're not the only one having this pain in your life. You can
  and will get through it.</p>

<h3>July 18, 2021</h3>

<p>Live life. That's the topic of this post. Simply live your life.
Don't let anyone else get in the way and tell you what's wrong with your
life. Don't let anyone get in your way or try and tell you how to live your
life.</p>

<p>Your life is yours and that's all that matters.</p>

<h3>July 12, 2021</h3>

<p>Why  must this life be so difficult? I don't understand  it.
It  would be nice if I could get a grasp on life somehow. How  do
you  get  a grasp on life exactly? That is the question  I  would
like answered. If I can't get an answer to that question, maybe I
could  get an answer to a different one. I would have to come  up
with the question in mind of course. As of now I don't know  what
the question is I would want answered.</p>

<h2>January</h2>

<h3>January 23, 2021</h3>

<p>Life takes random turns from time to time. There are days that are
  better than other days. Some of those days simply exist. While other
  days run and hide from everything else. It can be theraputic.</p>

<h3>January 21, 2021</h3>

<p>Somedays mistakes are made. This is the way of life.</p>

<h3>January 15, 2021</h3>

<p>Another weekend is here. There's not much to be said regarding
  the weekend. It's just another weekend now isn't it. No that wasn't
  a question. It was more of a statement. I prefer a relaxing weekend
  in which I don't have to do anything if I don't want to.</p>

<h3>January 13, 2021</h3>

<p>Sometimes it doesn't make sense. This life that is. There
  are somedays where you just have to wonder what's going on.
  Not everything has to make sense, I mean if everything did
  life wouldn't be mysterious. It would be boring I suppose.</p>

<p>So here we sit with a life that's not boring. I think that's
  a good start don't you?</p>

<p>We just have to figure out why we're here. If there's a purpose
  to any of it. That's the question that will be on the minds of people
  long into the dead of night.</p>

<h3>January 11, 2021</h3>

<p>Small town newspapers tell it all. They know everybody's
  business and then some. I'd rather not end up in such
  a place, a newspaper that is. No one needs to know
  what I'm up to on a moments notice.</p>

<p>But when you live in a small town, the gossip is all
  there is to it. Everything becomes known eventually.
  That's just how it is.</p>

<h3>January 10, 2021</h3>

<p>There are times where you just have to sit back
  and wonder about all the different possibilities
  out there. Some are good others are bad. Either way
  they are possibilities.</p>

<p>You  might want to do one thing on a certain day
  and another thing on a different day. But you just
  never know what will happen unless you try. If you
  give it a shot first, then you'll know if you're up
  to whatever it was you wanted to do.</p>

<h3>January 8, 2021</h3>

<p>Let's hope this year is better than last year.
  But does hoping really help?</p>
