<h2>January</h2>

<h3>January 11, 2021</h3>

<p>Small town newspapers tell it all. They know everybody's
  business and then some. I'd rather not end up in such
  a place, a newspaper that is. No one needs to know
  what I'm up to on a moments notice.</p>

<p>But when you live in a small town, the gossip is all
  there is to it. Everything becomes known eventually.
  That's just how it is.</p>

<h3>January 10, 2021</h3>

<p>There are times where you just have to sit back
  and wonder about all the different possibilities
  out there. Some are good others are bad. Either way
  they are possibilities.</p>

<p>You  might want to do one thing on a certain day
  and another thing on a different day. But you just
  never know what will happen unless you try. If you
  give it a shot first, then you'll know if you're up
  to whatever it was you wanted to do.</p>

<h3>January 8, 2021</h3>

<p>Let's hope this year is better than last year.
  But does hoping really help?</p>
