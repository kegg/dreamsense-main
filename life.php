<h2>The Mutant</h2>

<p>Life didn't seem to matter that much. It wasn't in the cards for Mike. He wanted
something better to happen, something better to take place, but it never did.
Mike was what you would call a mutant. He wasn't human, and yet he wasn't fully
alien. He was a cross breed.</p>

<p>Scientists would do whatever research they wanted to on him. He wasn't fond of
that much. Everytime they would probe him, he would jump. A blood sample here,
a saliva sample there. They wnated to know what made him tick.</p>

<p>Mike wasn't one for games. It had to end.</p>
