<h2>Vampire</h2>

<p>"I went to bed early, that's all."</p>

<p>"That's all." She said "Like you expect me to believe it."</p>

<p>He smiled back. "Yes I expect you to believe it, why wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>The woman placed her hands on her hips. "Because you're a liar. I know for a
fact you went back out."</p>

<p>"Says who?"</p>

<p>"Says me!"</p>

<p>He bit his bottom lip. Did she really see everything that had taken place the
night before? Did she see how he hovered over his prey before making the attack?
Vampires had to be careful after all, one slip up and it's all over.</p>

<h2>The Drink</h2>

<p>He leaped towards the man, teeth grinding together. Anything more would be
  cause for treason. But John knew that, he knew where his limits lay and knew
  which boundaries not to cross.</p>

<p>"Care to say that again?" John yelled.</p>

<p>The man was shaking, quivering to the point of almost passing out.
  "No, no I would rather not." He replied.</p>

<p>"I see" John said. "In that case, care to have a drink?"</p>

<p>The man couldn't believe what he was hearing. A drink? Was John sure about
  that? He nodded slowly. "Yes sir."</p>

<p>John smiled as he poured two glasses of whiskey.</p>

<h2>Truth</h2>

<p>Everything becomes a realism at some point or another. No one decides what you
  wish to believe or want to understand. That is up to you. To want to believe
  in something takes courage. To want to understand what that belief is? Even
  more courage. What it all takes is courage to see the truth in something no
  matter what.</p>

<p>There are times when we do not want to see the truth. We want to hide from
  it all. Kept safe in the world we created for ourselves. That peace of mind
  upon which we have the ability to stand.</p>

<h2>The Mutant</h2>

<p>Life didn't seem to matter that much. It wasn't in the cards for Mike. He wanted
something better to happen, something better to take place, but it never did.
Mike was what you would call a mutant. He wasn't human, and yet he wasn't fully
alien. He was a cross breed.</p>

<p>Scientists would do whatever research they wanted to on him. He wasn't fond of
that much. Everytime they would probe him, he would jump. A blood sample here,
a saliva sample there. They wnated to know what made him tick.</p>

<p>Mike wasn't one for games. It had to end.</p>
