<h3>August 18, 2022</h3>

<p>It's another day. It's always another day. I wonder what would happen if all
  these other days would just disappear. Something tells me that's not how any 
  of this works. But who's to say what will happen in the future?</p>

<p>It would be nice if I could figure out exactly what's going on most days.
  But I'm not sure exactly how that would even go down. It's annoying at best.</p>
