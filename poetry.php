<h2><a name="life"></a>Life</h2>
<p>Living a life that's full and free<br/>
  Never a moment yet to be seen<br/>
  Let it come out in the darkest of nights<br/>
  If only a moment we breathe a relief</p>

<h2><a name="savior"></a>The Savior</h2>
<p>The Street was full of people<br/>
  A bright star in the sky<br/>
  People were looking heavenward<br/>
  A Savior was nearby</p>
<p>The boy was born of Mary<br/>
  And sent from God above<br/>
  To fulfill a mission<br/>
  And show us of His love</p>
<p>As life moved on He grew<br/>
  And always remembered the plan<br/>
  Given of His father<br/>
  He was no ordinary man</p>
<p>He taught the people boldly<br/>
  With authority from God<br/>
  The parables He'd given<br/>
  Would help out in His cause</p>
<p>The Jews rejected His message<br/>
  He knew that He would die<br/>
  Yet He still spake boldly<br/>
"I am that bread of life."</p>
<p>He suffered in a garden<br/>
  With apostles outside the gate<br/>
  The soldiers took Him captive<br/>
  And He died on Calvary</p>
<p>The heavens cried with thunder<br/>
  As rain fell to the earth<br/>
  Christ had done what was needed<br/>
  Ever since His birth</p>
<p>Three days passed with darkness<br/>
  A resurrection came<br/>
  Jesus fulfilled His mission<br/>
  So we can know His name</p>

<h2><a name="friends"></a>Friends For Eternity</h2>
<p>You were standing on my step that rainy afternoon<br/>
  I opened the door and allowed you entrance, I made room<br/>
  As you entered my life I felt your spirit reach out to me<br/>
  I knew we would be friends for eternity</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="spirit"></a>The Spirit</h2>
<p>If you're quiet, you can hear it<br/>
  That still small voice we call the Spirit<br/>
  The Spirit is a peacful whisper<br/>
  A still small voice that sinks deeper</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="piano"></a>Piano Of Life</h2>
<p>I rest my hands on white keys<br/>
  A piano sits in front of me<br/>
  I began to play a song or two<br/>
  From a Hymn Book in my view</p>
<p>The Grand Piano's made of oak<br/>
  I think to myself "Will it float"?<br/>
  The song continues and with time<br/>
  My Orchestra of life sounds just fine</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="bday"></a>Happy B-Day</h2>
<p>"Happy Birthday" I sing to you<br/>
  Even though its words are few<br/>
  I hope that you will have a day<br/>
  Where you can sleep in and play</p>
<p>Everyone comes here to earth<br/>
  It's that miracle we call birth<br/>
  From that time on we celebrate<br/>
  Our birth event at a yearly rate</p>
<p>Birthdays can be a source of joy<br/>
  A time to yell "Wow!" and "Oh Boy!"<br/>
  It's your special day set aside<br/>
  So take the car for a joy ride</p>
<p>When your birthday comes around<br/>
  Don't be staring at the ground<br/>
  Get up, get out, and get away<br/>
  I hope you enjoy your happy day!</p>

<h2><a name="cat"></a>Ode To My Cat</h2>
<p>Oh little kitty<br/>
  how you must purr<br/>
  live life to it's fullest<br/>
  and not choosing to grrr</p>
<p>My precious sunshine<br/>
  why do you care<br/>
  to meow at shadows<br/>
  and laugh at thin air?</p>
<p>Light beams come and go<br/>
  through the world you see<br/>
  only staying for a brief moment<br/>
  then flying away like a bee</p>
<p>So little Kenya<br/>
  who's name has been changed<br/>
  to one called Maggie<br/>
  my you are strange</p>
<p>Poems about animals<br/>
  are meant as a gift<br/>
  not to mock or blame<br/>
  but rather to uplift</p>
<p>My little cat<br/>
  who sits on my lap<br/>
  falls asleep so easily<br/>
  and takes a long long nap</p>
