<h2>September</h2>

<h3>September 19, 2020</h3>

<p>After basically being on lockdown for a good solid year, you learn to appreciate
  certain things. Like going outside without a mask. Giving a needed hug. Things
  like that.</p>

<p>Nowadays wherever you go, you have to wear a mask and stay six feet apart from
  other people. I understand it's for health concerns and all of that. I get that.
  It's a good measure so people don't get sick. I just wonder who thought six feet
  was the optimal distance to stay away from another person.</p>

<h3>September 8, 2020</h3>

<p>It's quite windy out today. It's supposed to be windy all afternoon. I'm not
  looking forward to this. It's supposed to drop forty degrees as well. With
  a high of 58. Yeah, that'll be nice and cold. Bye summer...for a day. THen it
  will get hot again. I think I'm ready for winter almost. Fall for sure.</p>

<p>I keep seeing these tutorials here and there. One thing they all have in
  common is they show how to install something using Windows. Not everyone uses
  Windows. Some people use Linux or a Mac. There's a wide range of computer
  users out there and Windows isn't the only operating system.</p>

<h3>September 7, 2020</h3>

<p>It would be nice to be able to understand all that is going on in the world.
  There doesn't always seem to be that confidence. Life is just that, life.
  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to figure out everything that needed to be
  figured out? I mean, we're here aren't we? Yeah that's what I was thinking.</p>

<h3>September 6, 2020</h3>

<p>Today is but a day. There isn't much to say about it. Trying to get things
  in order because why not. That's simply how the day begins and ends.</p>
<p>Knock on wood, I've yet to get Covid 19 or experience a Murder Hornet. I
  think that's a good accomplishment for this year, even if those are the only
  accomplishments I actually get this year.</p>
